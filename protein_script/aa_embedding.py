# The mapping here uses hhblits convention, so that B is mapped to D, J and O
# are mapped to X, U is mapped to C, and Z is mapped to E. Other than that the
# remaining 20 amino acids are kept in alphabetical order.
# There are 2 non-amino acid codes, X (representing any amino acid) and
# "-" representing a missing amino acid in an alignment.  The id for these
# codes is put at the end (20 and 21) so that they can easily be ignored if
# desired.
